0,WalmartCustomer,"May 13, 2021","I am so happy, finally, the general public has the ability to purchase cleaning products again. It was so difficult to buy them. The wipes are easy to take out. I used it for clean kids toys, doors, TV tables, counter tops in kitchen and bathrooms. Bonus point: kills COVID-19 VIRUS!",(5.0),Value for money
1,Jessica,"December 23, 2020","Love these! They last long in our vehicles even in the summer heat. To help prevent drying out and from them leaking since they have a lot of liquid in them, I place the container in a zip lock bag. They are thick. They do not tear easily, and I like the fabric type texture.",(5.0),Great Product!
2,Yoshira,"April 10, 2021",Product is great! only issue was either the packaging or delivery service since I ordered 2 packs one of them came soaked not sure If it open and spilled all over or of there was a hole.,(4.0),Not really fit for shipping.
3,TampaDeb,"December 27, 2020",All three containers leaked in transit. I use to use the 24/7 pre COVID. Now it is so hard to get them. They said I could refund or replace. I asked for replacement now they are out of stock.,(3.0),Open containers
4,lamis,"July 29, 2020","Of course I love the Clorox wipes. My problem is with  the way they arrived. 2 of the 3 containers were opened and leaking, causing the entire package to get wet. All of the labels were ripped off, literally just wrapped around the containers.",(3.0),Damaged
5,Alison,"May 16, 2020","I was so happy to find these in stock, finally, and be able to order them. I've ordered a lot of stuff from Walmart recently (usually I use mostly amazon). happy with everything so far -- but really disappointed. They have arrived looking like in the photo, two of the containers are dried out. How can all three have sprung a leak? The lids were on relatively securely.",(1.0),Awful
6,dillansgramma,"January 12, 2014","I ordered these because the price was right and I use these often. They arrived, and I took them out of the box. The next morning I took them out of the box and the fluid had spilt all over my counter tops and the labels were coming off and the blue ink dyed my hands and counter. I am diligently trying to get the counter tops cleared off and my fingers are still blue but getting lighter. I definitely would not order these again through the mail. I am very disappointed and all the labels have come off of the containers. Very poor service/quality.",(1.0),Be Careful
7,Nadia,"December 21, 2020",I don't know why walmart keeps sending disinfectant any wipes that have clearly been opened. I had ordered baby ganics wipes awhile back and had to return them. I can't trust that they haven't been used or tampered with if they arrive open. there is no foil seal on the inside.,(1.0),Package NOT leak proof
8,Debra,"July 13, 2021",Containers of wipes were dented and must have leaked cleaner liquid because Clorox labels were peeled off containers.,(1.0),Hands Down The Best Wipe Ever!
9,Kelly,"March 17, 2021",lid of the middle container was cracked/broken.   Items were placed in the box on its side so liquid leaked all over the box and other containers.  I assume these wipes will dry up quickly and be useless for me.,(1.0),Needs Better Shipping
10,MrsWilliams,"September 3, 2020",Container not securely made for delivery. The liquid from wipes leaked in the box and inside of the package that contains the three. No inner protection from leaking on each individual container. The blue ink from outer package bleed all on my hands because of leak.  Had to request refund.,(1.0),Need better Walmart shipping packaging.
11,Alicia,"July 28, 2021",Clorox products are always the best choice. No strong scent. No irritants. Highly recommend,(5.0),Came busted and not properly wrapped.
12,Arrid,"August 3, 2020","I read all the horror stories on how customers got there order and the containers were either busted, leaking or broken. So i was reluctant to get my order, BUT to my surprise first off I was shocked out of this world they were available AND that i actually received them!! But i did,  Thanks Walmart",(3.0),I'll need a refund.  It's got to be our hot temps?
13,Lee,"August 21, 2020",Mine came with no seal either. Liquid leaked all over paper labels tearing them and wipes were pretty dry. Pre-covid these were sealed I dont know why they wouldnt be now. Thanks Walmart for making it right though.,(2.0),
14,GURDISH,"April 26, 2020",The product works but packaging was bad. Apparently it leaked and everything got wet.,(2.0),

18,Nick,"July 27, 2020","I ordered 2 and it was 6 dollar shipping for each items. Considering that the wipes are hard to come by nowdays i had to order two and paid $12 in shipping. One came properly boxed up and with buble wraps and the other just on a plastic bag, it was open and squized to the poit that all the wipes were dry. I tried to return them but it was a pain to pack them and send it back in which it makes no sense sending a busted wipes. I gave one star for the delivery and not the item.",(1.0),
19,June,"July 27, 2021",all the liquid was drained out of all three containers and the paper was peeling off the sides of each of them by the time and took the outer plastic off.  They must have tipped inside of the box or got too hot inside the truck or something.  I'm not sure.,(1.0),
